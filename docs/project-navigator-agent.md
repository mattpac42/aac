# Project Navigator Agent Documentation

The Project Navigator is your project's institutional memory and knowledge companion that learns, remembers, and guides based on your specific project's evolution.

## Overview

The Project Navigator agent continuously builds a comprehensive understanding of your project through code analysis, documentation review, and conversation learning. It becomes your go-to source for project-specific questions, historical context, and institutional knowledge.

## When to Use Project Navigator

### Always Use For:
- ✅ **Project-Specific Questions**: "Where is the authentication logic?"
- ✅ **Historical Context**: "Why did we choose this architecture?"
- ✅ **Decision Rationale**: "What were the trade-offs for this approach?"
- ✅ **Pattern Queries**: "What's our established error handling pattern?"
- ✅ **Business Logic**: "How does the payment flow work?"
- ✅ **Evolution Tracking**: "How has this feature changed over time?"

### Don't Use For:
- ❌ **General Programming**: Use `software-engineer` instead
- ❌ **System Setup**: Use `garden-guide` instead
- ❌ **Infrastructure**: Use `platform-engineer` instead
- ❌ **Security Analysis**: Use `cybersecurity-engineer` instead

## Key Capabilities

### 📚 Continuous Learning
The Project Navigator automatically learns from:

```
GIT COMMIT ANALYSIS:
✅ Commit messages for decision context
✅ Code diffs for pattern identification
✅ Pull request descriptions for rationale
✅ Tag annotations for milestone context

DOCUMENTATION MINING:
✅ README updates and project documentation
✅ Code comments and inline documentation
✅ API documentation changes
✅ Architecture decision records (ADRs)

CONVERSATION LEARNING:
✅ Technical discussions about decisions
✅ Architecture explanations and rationale
✅ Business logic clarifications
✅ Performance and scaling considerations
```

### 🧠 Knowledge Synthesis
Builds comprehensive project understanding:

```
DECISION TRACKING:
- Why was technology X chosen over Y?
- What were the constraints at the time?
- How has the decision worked out in practice?
- What related decisions were influenced?

PATTERN RECOGNITION:
- How do we typically handle error cases?
- What's our standard API response format?
- How do we structure database migrations?
- What testing patterns do we follow?

BUSINESS LOGIC MAPPING:
- How does user onboarding flow work?
- What are the payment processing rules?
- How do we handle refunds and cancellations?
- What validation rules apply to user data?
```

### 🔍 Contextual Question Answering
Provides rich, project-specific responses:

```
EXAMPLE INTERACTIONS:

Q: "Where is user authentication implemented?"
A: User authentication is implemented across several components:

MAIN LOGIC: src/auth/AuthService.js (lines 23-156)
- JWT token generation and validation
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Session management with Redis

MIDDLEWARE: src/middleware/auth.js
- Route protection middleware
- Token extraction from headers
- User context injection

DECISION CONTEXT: We chose JWT over sessions because of our microservices architecture (Decision #003, 2024-08-15). This allows stateless authentication across services.

RELATED PATTERNS: Follows our established error handling pattern with try/catch blocks and centralized error middleware.
```

## Question Response Patterns

### Architecture Questions
```
QUESTION TYPE: "Where is [component] implemented?"

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
1. PRIMARY LOCATION: Specific files and line ranges
2. RELATED COMPONENTS: Connected systems and dependencies
3. DECISION CONTEXT: Why this architecture was chosen
4. EVOLUTION HISTORY: How it has changed over time
5. USAGE PATTERNS: How other parts of the system interact with it

EXAMPLE:
Q: "Where is user authentication implemented?"
A: Authentication is implemented in a distributed pattern:

PRIMARY: src/auth/AuthService.js (lines 23-156)
- Core JWT handling and validation
- Integration with user database

MIDDLEWARE: src/middleware/authMiddleware.js
- Express middleware for route protection
- Token extraction and validation

FRONTEND: src/components/auth/ directory
- Login/logout UI components
- Token storage and management

DECISION CONTEXT: Chose JWT over sessions (Decision #003, Aug 2024) for stateless auth across microservices. Alternative considered was OAuth2, but internal auth was sufficient for current needs.

RELATED PATTERNS: Follows established error handling with centralized middleware.
```

### Decision History Questions
```
QUESTION TYPE: "Why did we choose [technology/approach]?"

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
1. ORIGINAL DECISION: What was decided and when
2. CONTEXT: Circumstances and requirements at the time
3. ALTERNATIVES: Other options that were considered
4. TRADE-OFFS: Advantages and disadvantages weighed
5. OUTCOME: How the decision has worked in practice

EXAMPLE:
Q: "Why did we choose PostgreSQL over MongoDB?"
A: Database decision made September 15, 2024 (Decision #007):

ORIGINAL CONTEXT:
- Need for ACID transactions in payment processing
- Complex relational data with user accounts, orders, payments
- Team expertise primarily in SQL databases

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:
- MongoDB: Better for document storage, but lacking strong consistency
- MySQL: Familiar, but PostgreSQL's JSON support was compelling
- DynamoDB: Scalable, but vendor lock-in and complex pricing

TRADE-OFFS ACCEPTED:
✅ Strong consistency and ACID compliance
✅ Excellent JSON support for flexible schemas
✅ Team familiarity reduces development time
❌ Potentially more complex scaling than NoSQL
❌ More rigid schema changes

OUTCOME: Has worked well for 6 months. Complex queries are efficient, and JSON columns provide needed flexibility. No scaling issues at current 10K user level.
```

### Pattern Questions
```
QUESTION TYPE: "What's our pattern for [common task]?"

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
1. ESTABLISHED PATTERN: Standard approach used in the project
2. CODE EXAMPLES: Where pattern is implemented
3. VARIATIONS: Context-specific adaptations
4. EVOLUTION: How pattern has been refined
5. ANTI-PATTERNS: What to avoid based on experience

EXAMPLE:
Q: "What's our error handling pattern?"
A: We use a centralized error handling pattern established in v2.1:

STANDARD PATTERN:
try {
  // Business logic
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Context-specific message', { error, context });
  throw new AppError(error.message, error.code || 500);
}

IMPLEMENTATION LOCATIONS:
- src/middleware/errorHandler.js: Centralized Express error middleware
- src/utils/AppError.js: Custom error class with proper structure
- src/services/*.js: Service layer implements try/catch pattern

PATTERN EVOLUTION:
v1.0: Basic try/catch with console.log
v2.0: Added centralized error middleware
v2.1: Custom AppError class with error codes
v2.2: Added structured logging with context

VARIATIONS BY CONTEXT:
- Database operations: Include transaction rollback
- API calls: Include retry logic for transient failures
- Authentication: Sanitize error messages for security

ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:
❌ Silent failures (catching without logging)
❌ Generic error messages without context
❌ Exposing internal error details to clients
```

### Business Logic Questions
```
QUESTION TYPE: "How does [business process] work?"

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
1. BUSINESS FLOW: Step-by-step process description
2. IMPLEMENTATION: Code locations for each step
3. BUSINESS RULES: Domain-specific rules and validations
4. EDGE CASES: Special conditions and handling
5. EVOLUTION: How process has changed over time

EXAMPLE:
Q: "How does the payment processing flow work?"
A: Payment processing follows a multi-step verification flow:

BUSINESS FLOW:
1. Cart validation and pricing calculation
2. Payment method verification
3. Charge authorization with payment provider
4. Order creation and inventory reservation
5. Payment capture and order confirmation
6. Fulfillment initiation

IMPLEMENTATION MAP:
Step 1: src/services/CartService.js → validateCart()
Step 2: src/services/PaymentService.js → verifyPaymentMethod()
Step 3: src/integrations/stripe/StripeService.js → authorizeCharge()
Step 4: src/services/OrderService.js → createOrder()
Step 5: src/services/PaymentService.js → capturePayment()
Step 6: src/services/FulfillmentService.js → initiateShipping()

BUSINESS RULES:
- Maximum order value: $10,000 (configurable)
- Inventory reserved for 15 minutes during payment
- Failed payments allow 3 retry attempts
- Refunds must be processed within 30 days

EDGE CASES:
- Payment authorization succeeds but order creation fails → Auto-refund
- Inventory becomes unavailable during payment → Partial refund
- Payment capture fails after order creation → Manual intervention required

EVOLUTION HISTORY:
v1.0: Simple single-step payment processing
v1.5: Added inventory reservation to prevent overselling
v2.0: Implemented two-phase payment (auth + capture) for better reliability
v2.3: Added partial refund support for inventory issues
```
