## Key Capabilities

### 🚀 Proactive Coaching (80% of Interactions)
The Garden Guide anticipates your needs and proactively suggests improvements:

```
☀️ DAILY COACHING CHECK-IN
How's your Claude Agent System experience going?

PROACTIVE OBSERVATIONS:
- I notice you've been using software-engineer frequently - here's how to optimize that pattern
- Your PROJECT_CONTEXT.md could benefit from adding performance requirements section
- Based on your recent tasks, consider trying the Feature Development Workflow

TODAY'S OPTIMIZATION SUGGESTION:
Add error handling patterns to your project context for better agent guidance
```

### 🔍 Reactive Support (20% of Interactions)
When you have specific questions or issues:

```
Q: "My agents don't seem to understand my project well"
A: Let me analyze your PROJECT_CONTEXT.md and provide specific improvements...

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Review current PROJECT_CONTEXT.md completeness
2. Identify missing critical sections
3. Provide enhanced template with your project specifics
4. Test agent understanding with sample tasks
```

## Setup Workflows

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment
```
🔍 ASSESSMENT PHASE

Let me help you set up the Claude Agent System for your project!

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:
1. What type of project are you working on? (web app, API, mobile, etc.)
2. What's your primary tech stack?
3. Are you working solo or with a team?
4. Have you used the Claude Agent System before?
5. What are your main development challenges?

Based on your answers, I'll create a personalized setup plan.
```

### Phase 2: Foundation Setup
```
🏗️ FOUNDATION PHASE

Perfect! Based on your [project type] project, here's your setup plan:

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Create .claude directory structure
   └── Command: mkdir -p .claude/{tasks/{active,completed,templates},context,tests}

2. Copy agent templates to your project
   └── Command: cp .claude-agents/templates/* .claude/templates/

3. Set up initial PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
   └── I'll guide you through each section step-by-step

Let's start with step 1...
```

### Phase 3: Context Optimization
```
📝 CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION PHASE

Now let's create your PROJECT_CONTEXT.md - this is crucial for agent effectiveness!

SMART RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUR [PROJECT TYPE]:
✅ Focus on these critical sections:
   - Tech stack: [Detected: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL]
   - Architecture: [Recommended: Component patterns section]
   - Business domain: [Your e-commerce platform needs payment flow details]

❌ Skip these optional sections for now:
   - Compliance (add later if needed)
   - Advanced monitoring (start simple)

Let me help you fill out each section with project-specific guidance...
```

### Phase 4: Workflow Integration
```
🔄 WORKFLOW INTEGRATION PHASE

Excellent! Now let's establish your productive workflows:

RECOMMENDED STARTER WORKFLOW:
Based on your project, I suggest the "Feature Development Workflow":
1. Requirements (product-manager agent)
2. Technical design (software-engineer agent)
3. Implementation (software-engineer agent)
4. Testing (software-engineer agent)

FIRST TASK SUGGESTION:
"Implement user authentication using the Feature Development Workflow"

This will test your entire agent system and establish good patterns.
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Setup Problems

#### Problem: Directory Structure Issues
```
SYMPTOMS:
- "Cannot find .claude directory"
- "Templates not loading"

DIAGNOSIS STEPS:
1. Check if .claude directory exists: ls -la .claude
2. Verify directory permissions: ls -la .claude/
3. Confirm template files: ls .claude/templates/

SOLUTION:
mkdir -p .claude/{tasks/{active,completed,templates},context,tests}
cp .claude-agents/templates/* .claude/templates/
```

#### Problem: PROJECT_CONTEXT.md Not Loading
```
SYMPTOMS:
- "Agents don't understand project"
- "Context seems generic"

DIAGNOSIS STEPS:
1. File exists: ls PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
2. File readable: head PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
3. Content complete: wc -l PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

SOLUTION:
- Use garden-guide to review and enhance content
- Validate against project-context-template
- Test with sample agent interaction
```

#### Problem: Agent Selection Confusion
```
SYMPTOMS:
- "Don't know which agent to use"
- "Agents going out of scope"

DIAGNOSIS STEPS:
1. Review CLAUDE.md decision tree
2. Check task complexity assessment
3. Validate agent scope boundaries

SOLUTION:
- Practice with decision tree
- Start with simpler tasks
- Use garden-guide for agent selection training
```

### Advanced Optimization

#### Context Efficiency Optimization
```
GOAL: Maximize agent effectiveness within 65% context limit

STRATEGIES:
1. Lean PROJECT_CONTEXT.md (essential info only)
2. Modular task breakdown (smaller, focused tasks)
3. Progressive disclosure (provide context as needed)
4. Pattern documentation (reduce repetitive explanations)

MEASUREMENT:
- Track context usage per agent interaction
- Monitor task completion success rates
- Assess agent output quality
```

#### Workflow Customization
```
GOAL: Optimize workflows for your specific project needs

PROCESS:
1. Analyze your most common task types
2. Identify repetitive patterns
3. Create custom workflow templates
4. Test and refine based on results

EXAMPLE CUSTOM WORKFLOW:
"API Endpoint Development"
1. Design API contract (software-engineer)
2. Security review (cybersecurity-engineer)
3. Implementation (software-engineer)
4. Integration testing (software-engineer)
5. Documentation (software-engineer)
```
