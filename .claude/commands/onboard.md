# Onboard Command

**Task**: Complete onboarding workflow: configure workspace colors, set up audio notifications, optionally create product vision, and populate project context through guided discovery.

## Usage

```bash
/onboard [primary] [secondary]
```

**Arguments**:
- `[primary]` (optional): Primary color or theme keyword
- `[secondary]` (optional): Secondary color (only used with primary color)

**Examples**:
- `/onboard` - Interactive mode, prompts for color selection
- `/onboard red` - Apply Red + Orange theme
- `/onboard ocean` - Apply Blue + Teal theme
- `/onboard red blue` - Apply Red primary + Blue secondary
- `/onboard purple orange` - Apply Purple primary + Orange secondary

## Steps

1. **Parse Command Arguments**
   - Check if any color arguments were provided
   - **No arguments**: Proceed with interactive workflow
   - **One argument**: Match against theme keywords or single-color mappings
   - **Two arguments**: Use first as primary, second as secondary (custom pairing)

2. **Detect Project Context**
   - Get the current project directory name
   - Extract project name from git remote (if available)
   - Identify project type/purpose from README or package.json

3. **Initialize VS Code Workspace**
   - Check if `.vscode/settings.json` exists
   - If not, create `.vscode/` directory
   - Copy `.claude/templates/vscode-settings-template.json` to `.vscode/settings.json`

4. **Analyze Current Color Scheme**
   - Read `.vscode/settings.json`
   - Extract current primary and secondary colors
   - Check if colors are still default template (Green: `#22c55e`/`#166534`, Brown: `#78350f`/`#d97706`)

5. **Determine Theme to Apply**

   **If two color arguments provided** (e.g., `/onboard red blue`):
   - Use first argument as primary color
   - Use second argument as secondary color
   - Look up hex codes from Color Hex Code Mapping
   - Calculate blended background color
   - Apply custom pairing immediately
   - Skip interactive prompts

   **If one color argument provided** (e.g., `/onboard red`):
   - Match argument against theme keywords (see Theme Keyword Mapping below)
   - Apply matching predefined theme immediately
   - Skip interactive prompts

   **If no arguments (interactive mode)**:
   - Infer theme from project name using keyword matching
   - Present options to user:
     - A) Use inferred theme (if matched)
     - B) Choose from 10+ example color pairings
     - C) Keep current colors

6. **Apply Color Scheme**
   - If user selects a theme, update `.vscode/settings.json`
   - Replace all 7 color instances:
     - Primary bright (line 8)
     - Primary dark (line 9)
     - Secondary dark (line 12)
     - Secondary light (line 13)
     - Background tint (line 16)
     - Theme name comment (line 3)
   - Confirm completion with theme name and colors

7. **Generate Audio Completion Notification**
   - Create `.claude/audio/` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Generate WAV audio file using macOS `say` command with a silly or cheeky saying based around the title of AIFF output, then convert:
     ```bash
     say -o .claude/audio/completion.aiff "[Project Name] is finished."
     afconvert .claude/audio/completion.aiff .claude/audio/completion.wav -d LEI16@44100 -f WAVE
     rm .claude/audio/completion.aiff
     ```
   - Example: For project "the_garden", generate something like "The garden is done growing." or with "the_gnomes", generate something like, "The gnomes are done playing around."
   - WAV format works on both macOS (afplay) and Windows (native)

8. **Success Confirmation**
   ```
   ✅ Workspace colors updated to [Theme Name]!
   - Primary: [Color Name] (#hexcode)
   - Secondary: [Color Name] (#hexcode)

   ✅ Audio notification created: .claude/audio/completion.wav

   Reload VS Code to see the new theme.
   ```

9. **Product Vision Discovery (Optional)**

   Determine if the project needs a product vision document.

   1. **Ask User About Project Scope**

      Present clear question to user:
      ```
      🎯 Would you like to create a product vision document?

      A product vision defines high-level objectives, target users, and strategic
      themes before diving into technical implementation.

      **Recommended for**: Full applications, multi-phase projects, products with
      multiple features or stakeholders

      **Skip for**: Single scripts, utilities, one-off tools, simple features

      Would you like to create a product vision? (Y/N)
      ```

   2. **If User Selects Yes (Y)**

      a. **Check for PRODUCT_VISION.md**:
         - Look in project root for `PRODUCT_VISION.md`
         - If doesn't exist, copy template: `cp .claude/templates/product-vision-template.md PRODUCT_VISION.md`

      b. **Detect Template Status**:
         - Read PRODUCT_VISION.md
         - Check if it contains template placeholder text like:
           - `[Project Name]`
           - `[Date]`
           - `[Name/Team]`
           - Or if file is mostly empty (< 1000 characters of actual content)

      c. **Invoke Product Visionary Agent**:

         If PRODUCT_VISION.md is template/empty:
         ```
         📋 Let's define your product vision!

         I'm going to have our product-visionary agent conduct a discovery
         interview to understand your product goals and populate the vision document.
         ```

         Then invoke the product-visionary agent with this task:
         ```
         Task: Conduct product vision discovery interview and populate PRODUCT_VISION.md

         Context: User has just completed workspace setup and wants to define product
         vision. The PRODUCT_VISION.md file exists but is still in template form.

         Constraints:
         - Use conversational, exploratory tone for discovery
         - Ask strategic questions about users, problems, and value proposition
         - Build understanding of high-level objectives and themes
         - Help user articulate vision clearly

         Expected Deliverables:
         1. Complete discovery interview covering vision, users, value prop, themes
         2. Fully populated PRODUCT_VISION.md with strategic themes defined
         3. Clear roadmap themes that can drive PRD creation

         Success Criteria:
         - All template placeholders replaced with actual vision content
         - User has clarity on high-level objectives
         - Strategic themes are defined for roadmap planning
         - PRODUCT_VISION.md is ready to guide technical PRD development
         ```

      d. **Completion Message**:
         After product-visionary completes:
         ```
         ✅ Product vision captured successfully!

         Your PRODUCT_VISION.md defines strategic themes that will guide
         feature development and PRD creation.

         Next: Let's set up your technical project context.
         ```

      e. **If PRODUCT_VISION.md Already Populated**:
         Skip product-visionary invocation and show:
         ```
         ✅ Product vision already defined!

         Moving to technical project setup...
         ```

   3. **If User Selects No (N)**

      Skip product vision creation:
      ```
      ⏭️  Skipping product vision.

      Moving to technical project setup...
      ```

   4. **Proceed to Step 10** (Project Context Discovery)

10. **Project Context Discovery**

   Check if PROJECT_CONTEXT.md needs to be populated:

   1. **Check for PROJECT_CONTEXT.md**
      - Look in project root for `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
      - If file doesn't exist, skip this step (user hasn't set up the system yet)

   2. **Detect Template/Empty Status**
      - Read the PROJECT_CONTEXT.md file
      - Check if it contains template placeholder text like:
        - `[Project Name]`
        - `[Brief Description]`
        - `<!-- Replace this template...`
        - Or if the file is mostly empty (< 500 characters of actual content)

   3. **Invoke Garden Guide Agent**

      If PROJECT_CONTEXT.md is template/empty:
      ```
      📋 I notice your PROJECT_CONTEXT.md is still a template. Let me help you fill it out!

      I'm going to have our garden-guide agent walk you through a discovery interview
      to understand your project and populate the context file.
      ```

      Then invoke the garden-guide agent with this task:
      ```
      Task: Conduct project discovery interview and populate PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

      Context: User has just completed workspace setup. The PROJECT_CONTEXT.md file
      exists but is still in template form and needs to be populated with actual
      project information.

      Constraints:
      - Use conversational, friendly tone for discovery questions
      - Ask questions one at a time or in small groups
      - Reference the project discovery question checklist
      - Build rapport while gathering information

      Expected Deliverables:
      1. Complete discovery interview covering all essential areas
      2. Fully populated PROJECT_CONTEXT.md file with user's project information
      3. Confirmation that the file has been saved

      Success Criteria:
      - All template placeholders replaced with actual project info
      - User feels their project context is accurately captured
      - PROJECT_CONTEXT.md is ready for use by other agents
      ```

   4. **Completion Message**
      After garden-guide completes:
      ```
      ✅ Project context captured successfully!

      Your PROJECT_CONTEXT.md is now populated and will help all agents
      understand your project better.

      🎉 Onboarding complete! You're ready to start working.
      ```

   5. **If PROJECT_CONTEXT.md Already Populated**
      Skip garden-guide invocation and show:
      ```
      ✅ Project context already configured!

      🎉 Onboarding complete! Your workspace is ready.
      ```

## How to Enable/Disable Features

### Audio Completion Notifications

**To Enable**: Add this to `.claude/settings.json` under `"hooks"`:

**macOS**:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": {
      "command": "afplay .claude/audio/completion.wav 2>/dev/null || true"
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows**: Use PowerShell to play WAV files:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": {
      "command": "powershell -c (New-Object Media.SoundPlayer '.claude/audio/completion.wav').PlaySync()"
    }
  }
}
```

**To Disable**: Remove the `"Stop"` hook from `.claude/settings.json`

**How it works**: After each prompt completion, the hook plays the audio file saying "[Project Name] is finished."

### Workspace Colors

**To Change Colors**: Run `/onboard` command again and select a new theme

**To Revert to Defaults**: Manually edit `.vscode/settings.json` and restore:
- Primary: `#22c55e` (bright), `#166534` (dark)
- Secondary: `#78350f` (dark), `#d97706` (light)
