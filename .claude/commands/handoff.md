description: Prepare handoff summary for next agent (project, gitignored)
---

You MUST create ACTUAL session handoff documentation FILES according to the AUTOMATIC SESSION HANDOFF PROTOCOL in CLAUDE.md.

**CRITICAL**: This command creates FILES using Write tool, not just chat summaries.

**Follow these steps exactly:**

1. **Determine Session Number**:
   - Check `.claude/context/session-history/` for existing session files
   - Find highest session number (e.g., if 011-SESSION.md exists, next is 012)
   - Use zero-padded 3-digit format (001, 002, 003, etc.)

2. **Create Session Summary File** (USING WRITE TOOL):
   - Read template: `.claude/templates/session-summary-template.md`
   - Create file: `.claude/context/session-history/[NUMBER]-SESSION.md`
   - Fill in ALL required sections with actual session data:
     * Date and duration
     * Context usage at handoff
     * Completed tasks with outcomes
     * Decisions made with rationale
     * Issues encountered (resolved and unresolved)
     * Files created/modified
     * Commands executed
     * Session statistics

3. **Create/Update Handoff File** (USING WRITE TOOL):
   - Read existing `.claude/context/session-history/HANDOFF-SESSION.md` first
   - Read template: `.claude/templates/handoff-session-template.md`
   - Overwrite: `.claude/context/session-history/HANDOFF-SESSION.md`
   - Fill in ALL required sections with forward-looking information:
     * Current status and progress
     * Prioritized next steps with context
     * Active blockers and issues
     * Important decisions and context
     * Working files and git state
     * Quick start guide for next session
     * Reference to the session file you just created

4. **Quality Validation**:
   - Ensure DELEGATION MANDATE section is included in HANDOFF-SESSION.md
   - Verify all template sections are filled (not placeholder text)
   - Check that next steps are prioritized and actionable
   - Confirm git status and branch information is accurate
   - Validate file paths and references are correct

5. **Confirm Files Created**:
   - Tell user: "Created `.claude/context/session-history/[NUMBER]-SESSION.md`"
   - Tell user: "Updated `.claude/context/session-history/HANDOFF-SESSION.md`"
   - Show file paths so user can verify

**MANDATORY**: You MUST use the Write tool to create these files. Providing a summary in chat is NOT SUFFICIENT. The files must exist on disk for the next session to read them.

**Example of CORRECT behavior**:
```
1. Read .claude/templates/session-summary-template.md
2. Use Write tool to create .claude/context/session-history/012-SESSION.md
3. Read .claude/context/session-history/HANDOFF-SESSION.md (existing)
4. Use Write tool to overwrite .claude/context/session-history/HANDOFF-SESSION.md
5. Tell user: "✅ Created 012-SESSION.md and updated HANDOFF-SESSION.md"
```

**Example of INCORRECT behavior** (DO NOT DO THIS):
```
"Here's a handoff summary for the next session: [long text in chat]"
```
