## 🚨 DELEGATION MANDATE 🚨

**Before starting ANY work in the next session:**

1. **Read CLAUDE.md Section**: "PRIMARY OPERATING PRINCIPLE" - Main agent is ORCHESTRATOR, not EXECUTOR
2. **Remember**: 99% of ALL work must be delegated to specialized agents
3. **Check**: Am I about to do implementation work? → STOP and delegate instead
4. **Agent unavailable?** → Inform user and wait, don't do the work yourself

**Exception Scenarios (Main Agent Can Work Directly)**:
- ✅ Simple clarifying questions (< 2 sentences)
- ✅ Trivial file reads for context gathering before delegation
- ✅ Coordinating between multiple agent outputs
- ✅ User explicitly says "skip agents and do it yourself"

**When Agent Sessions Hit Limit**:
- ❌ DO NOT switch to doing work directly
- ✅ Explain the blocker to user
- ✅ Ask if they want to wait for agent reset (usually 1am)
- ✅ Document task for next session when agents are available
- ✅ Suggest alternative tasks that don't require agent delegation

**IF IN DOUBT**: Always delegate. Being too cautious about delegation is better than doing work directly.

**The 99% Delegation Rule is NON-NEGOTIABLE** - even when facing technical blockers.
