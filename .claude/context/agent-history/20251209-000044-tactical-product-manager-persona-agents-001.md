## 🎯 Decisions Made

### 1. Persona Role Selection
**Decision**: Focus on frequent AAC interaction roles across diverse contexts
**Rationale**:
- Special education teacher and paraprofessional provide school implementation perspective (vs. clinical SLP view)
- Retail and hospitality provide public interaction contexts
- Recreation provides active, fast-paced environment perspective
- All represent non-clinical, real-world AAC usage scenarios

**Decision**: Selected distinct, vibrant colors for each persona
**Rationale**:
- Yellow for teacher (bright, educational)
- Teal for paraprofessional (supportive, calm)
- Lime for cashier (energetic, public-facing)
- Deep orange for coach (active, energetic)
- Deep purple for server (hospitality, sophisticated)
- All colors distinct from existing persona-alex.md (#4CAF50 green)

### 3. Content Depth
**Decision**: Provide extensive, detailed personas with multiple scenarios
**Rationale**:
- Rich personas enable more nuanced feedback on AAC features
- Specific scenarios help identify edge cases and real-world requirements
- Detailed pain points inform feature prioritization
- Length comparable to existing persona-alex.md (81 lines) but expanded for professional contexts

### 4. Tone and Voice
**Decision**: Each persona has distinct voice reflecting their experience level and context
**Rationale**:
- Ms. Thompson: Experienced, protective, advocacy-focused
- Jake: Humble, practical, learning-oriented
- Sam: Uncertain, well-meaning, public-facing
