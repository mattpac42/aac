## Decisions Made

### 1. Persona Color Selection
**Decision**: Assigned distinct colors from different color families for each persona
**Rationale**: Visual differentiation in VSCode integration, colors match persona characteristics (cyan for clinical Jordan, red for passionate Maria, blue-grey for analytical Tom, light green for nurturing Linda, indigo for academic Dr. Chen)

### 2. Detail Depth by Persona Complexity
**Decision**: Varied detail depth based on persona complexity and stakeholder relationships
**Rationale**:
- Jordan: Clinical workflow and professional philosophy detailed
- Maria: Emotional reality and family dynamics emphasized
- Tom: Relationship dynamics and progressive disease context explored
- Linda: Technology anxiety and senior caregiver perspective highlighted
- Dr. Chen: Medical setting complexity and research orientation included

### 3. Bilingual Context for Maria
**Decision**: Emphasized Spanish/English bilingual household needs
**Rationale**: Reflects real-world AAC diversity, highlights product gap (most AAC apps English-only), adds cultural dimension to persona set

### 4. Progressive Disease Context for Tom
**Decision**: Included ALS progression and future-proofing needs
**Rationale**: Represents important stakeholder segment (acquired conditions), highlights need for adaptive AAC solutions, adds emotional depth to persona

### 5. Senior Technology Anxiety for Linda
**Decision**: Created persona with significant technology limitations
**Rationale**: Represents often-overlooked stakeholder (grandparent caregivers), highlights usability requirements beyond primary users, challenges product to be truly accessible

## Notes and Learnings

### Product Insights
- **Bilingual needs are critical**: Maria's persona highlights gap in most AAC apps (English-only)
- **Progressive disease requires future-proofing**: Tom's context shows need for adaptive AAC (touch → eye-gaze)
- **Senior caregivers need extreme simplicity**: Linda's technology anxiety highlights usability requirements
- **Medical settings have unique constraints**: Dr. Chen's context shows need for quick setup, HIPAA compliance, insurance documentation

### Persona Design Patterns
- **Emotional authenticity matters**: Each persona expresses genuine emotional reality (grief, hope, anxiety, determination)
- **Daily reality grounds personas**: Specific routines and scenarios make personas actionable for design decisions
- **Evaluation criteria enable feedback**: Clear "how I evaluate features" sections allow personas to review product decisions
- **Voice guidelines ensure consistency**: Response format sections help maintain persona authenticity when invoked

### Stakeholder Coverage
This persona set now represents:
- **Age range**: 5 to 71 (across AAC users and caregivers)
- **Roles**: AAC users, parents, spouses, grandparents, private practice SLPs, hospital SLPs
- **Settings**: Home, school, hospital, clinic, community
