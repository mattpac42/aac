## Context Provided

### Initial Discovery Insights (from Speech Pathologist Interview)

**Core Problem Identified**:
- Current AAC apps lack sufficient customization
- Users can't find exact word representations needed
- Boards are limiting, hard to navigate, difficult to customize
- Users forced to switch between multiple apps for all features
- Cannot add new words/concepts on the fly during conversations
- Constant guessing when exact words aren't available

**Primary User Personas**:
- Nonverbal users (individuals with communication disorders across all ages)
- Speech pathologists who design AAC systems for clients

**Key Value Propositions**:
- **Freedom**: Enable independent communication without interpreters
- **Expandability**: Grow from 3 buttons (child) to unlimited expression
- **Customization**: User ownership and personalization of boards
- **Completeness**: One comprehensive app eliminating app-switching
- **User-friendly**: Easy for both pathologists and end users

**Core Use Cases**:
- Daily needs communication (food, pain, requests)
- Social conversations with others
- Ordering food independently
- Expressing likes, dislikes, opinions
- Communicating with strangers without interpretation
- Growing with user from childhood to adulthood

**Success Vision from Speech Pathologist**:
- User-friendly for practitioners and users
- Contains majority of needed features in one app
- Can add missing features based on feedback
- "The one app that could be relied on"

**Competitive Differentiation**:
- Highly customizable and infinitely expandable
- No app-switching required
- Grows with user over time
- Easy word/concept addition on the fly
- User feedback-driven development

- Rationale: Directly measures freedom and independence vision

**Key Performance Indicators**:
- Weekly active users: 0 → 100 → 500 → 2,000
- Speech pathologist adoption: 0 → 20 → 100 → 500
- Average board vocabulary: 0 → 50 → 150 → 300 words
- User satisfaction (NPS): N/A → 40+ → 50+ → 60+
- App Store rating: N/A → 4.0+ → 4.3+ → 4.5+

- Daily communication events: N/A → 5 → 10 → 15

**OKRs Defined**:
- Objective 1: Product-market fit with pathologists and users (100 users, 20 pathologists, 50+ NPS, 80% retention)
- Objective 2: Prove customization value prop (70% customize in week 1, 10→100+ words in 3 months, 90% vocabulary coverage)
- Objective 3: User-friendly experience (80% first communication <10min, 4.3+ rating, 60% primary recommendation)

### 6. Product Principles Established

1. **User Freedom Over Platform Control**: Users own boards, we never dictate usage
2. **Growth Without Limits**: Scale from simplicity to complexity seamlessly
3. **One App, Complete Solution**: Eliminate reasons to switch apps
4. **Instant Responsiveness**: Communication is real-time (<200ms)
5. **Collaboration Enhances Autonomy**: Support empowers, doesn't replace independence
6. **Intelligent Assistance, Human Control**: AI assists, never overrides
7. **Accessibility First, Always**: Foundation, not feature

### 7. Scope Boundaries Defined

**In Scope for Vision (6-12 months)**:
- iOS native app (iPad/iPhone)
- Visual board builder with drag-and-drop
- Unlimited grid expansion and folders
- Custom symbol/photo upload
- Text-to-speech with voice selection
- Cloud sync and backup
- Real-time collaborative editing
- AI word prediction (phased after MVP)
- Role-based permissions
- Template library
- Search functionality
- Offline core functionality

**Out of Scope (Future)**:
- Android/web platforms (6-12 months post-MVP)
- Voice banking/personalized synthesis (12+ months)
- Eye-tracking/switch access (9-12 months)
- Multi-language support (12+ months)
- Insurance billing integration (12+ months)
- Third-party marketplace (12+ months)

**Strategic Trade-offs Documented**:
- iOS first vs. cross-platform: Faster time to market, native quality
- Visual builder vs. AI-generated: User control and ownership priority
- Collaboration vs. simplicity: Pathologist adoption critical for success

### 8. Validation Plan Created

**Key Assumptions to Validate**:
1. Speech pathologists adopt if superior customization + collaboration (Beta with 20 pathologists, month 1-3)
2. Users/caregivers customize independently (Usability testing 10 pairs, month 2-4)
3. Users rely on one app vs. switching (Survey concurrent usage, month 3-6)
4. AI prediction speeds communication without frustration (A/B test, month 4-6)
5. Collaboration improves vocabulary growth (Compare with/without collaborators, month 3-6)

**Validation Milestones**:
- Month 3: 100 users, 20 pathologists, validated customization, identified top 3 missing features
- Month 6: 500 users, 70%+ independent customization, 50+ NPS, validated collaboration value
- Month 12: 2,000 users, 500 pathologists, 60+ NPS, 4.5 rating, validated "one app" positioning

### 9. Next Steps Roadmap

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Validate vision with speech pathologist advisory group (Week 1)
2. Create feature roadmap using strategic-feature-architect agent (Week 2)
3. Generate PRDs for MVP features - Themes 1, 5, core of Theme 2 (Week 2-3)
4. Recruit beta speech pathologists for early access (Week 2-4)

**Vision-to-Execution Path**:
1. Feature Architecture → strategic-feature-architect decomposes themes into roadmap
2. Roadmap Planning → Prioritize epics by MVP needs, pathologist requirements, dependencies
3. PRD Generation → Create PRDs for visual builder, basic sync, onboarding, text-to-speech
4. Implementation → Execute via .claude/tasks/ PRD workflow
