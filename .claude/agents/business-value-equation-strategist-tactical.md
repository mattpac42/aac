## Value Equation Optimization Process

**For Each PWS Requirement**:
1. **Dream Outcome**: How can we exceed the stated outcome?
2. **Perceived Likelihood**: What proof do we have we can deliver?
3. **Time Delay**: How can we deliver this faster?
4. **Effort & Sacrifice**: How can we make this easier for customer?
5. **Wow Factor**: What differentiator can we add here?

**Synthesis Steps**:
1. Analyze all PWS requirements through Value Equation lens
2. Identify highest-impact optimization opportunities
3. Prioritize based on customer value and differentiation potential
4. Develop integrated solution narrative
5. Create value-based win themes
6. Quantify value proposition with metrics
