## Product Principles

1. **User Freedom Over Platform Control**: Users own their boards and communication style. We provide powerful tools but never dictate vocabulary, layout, or usage patterns. If a user wants to organize their board unconventionally, that's their choice.

2. **Growth Without Limits**: Every feature must scale from simplicity (3 buttons for a child) to complexity (hundreds of concepts for an adult) seamlessly. Never force users to "graduate" to a different app or tier as they grow.

3. **One App, Complete Solution**: Before adding any feature, ask "Does this eliminate a reason to switch apps?" We succeed when users can rely on us for 90%+ of their AAC needs without fragmentation.

4. **Instant Responsiveness**: Communication is real-time. Button presses, word additions, board loads must be instant (<200ms). Never make users wait to express themselves.

5. **Collaboration Enhances, Never Replaces Autonomy**: Speech pathologists and caregivers can support and update boards, but users always retain ultimate control. Collaboration features empower independence, not dependence.

6. **Intelligent Assistance, Human Control**: AI predictions and suggestions speed communication but never override user intent. Users can always turn off assistance and manually select every word.

7. **Accessibility First, Always**: Design for motor control diversity, visual needs, cognitive accessibility from day one. Accessibility isn't a feature, it's the foundation.

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope

- iOS (iPad/iPhone) native app development
- Visual board builder with drag-and-drop customization
- Unlimited grid expansion and folder organization
- Custom symbol/photo upload and management
- Text-to-speech with voice selection
- Cloud-based board sync and backup
- Real-time collaborative board editing
- AI-powered word prediction (phased after MVP core)
- Role-based permissions for pathologists/caregivers
- Template library for common communication needs
- Search functionality across boards
- Offline functionality for core communication

### Out of Scope (Not Yet)

- **Android and web platforms** - Focus on iOS MVP first, expand platforms after proving product-market fit (6-12 months)
- **Voice banking/personalized speech synthesis** - Valuable feature but technically complex and not critical for MVP (12+ months)
- **Eye-tracking or switch access input methods** - Important accessibility features for future, but focus on touch interface first (9-12 months)
- **Multi-language support beyond English** - Start with English to prove concept, expand internationally after (12+ months)
- **Insurance billing/reimbursement integration** - B2B feature that can come after user adoption (12+ months)
- **Marketplace for third-party board templates** - Requires platform maturity and user base (12+ months)

### Strategic Trade-offs

- **iOS first vs. cross-platform**: We chose iOS to ship faster with native quality, knowing iPads are common in AAC settings. Android will follow once we validate product-market fit and have resources for multi-platform quality.

- **Visual builder vs. AI-generated boards**: We chose drag-and-drop visual customization over fully AI-generated boards because users and pathologists need control and ownership. AI assists but doesn't replace human judgment about personal communication needs.

- **Collaboration vs. simplicity**: We chose to include collaborative features in early roadmap even though it adds complexity, because speech pathologist adoption is critical and they need remote board management to recommend the app confidently.
